# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Using-React
I built a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React, featuring a 3x3 interactive grid. Players alternate turns placing Xs and Os, with the game checking for wins and draws. A reset button allows for starting a new game. The project demonstrates React component usage, state management, and basic game logic.
